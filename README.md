# Predicting Developer Salaries

This was an artificial intelligence project aimed at attempting to predict developers' salaries using information about their location, number of years in industry, etc.

A few different models were used, but the overall result was somewhat disappointing; accuracy ended up being in the region of 60-70%, with salaries regularly being skewed by high-paying locations (e.g. London).
